## About me

Front end developing and making aesthetic, functional user interfaces is my passion. I received my B.S. in Computer Science at Brigham Young University - Hawaii ðŸ“š and I enjoy working with javascript and react.

I love learning and challenging myself and look forward to continuing my journey as a developer - you can [read some of my thoughts and experiences](https://brad0s.github.io/) on my blog.
